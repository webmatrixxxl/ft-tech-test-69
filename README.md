# Financial Times Technical Test

The test is in two parts. Please create a branch to do you work and tell us when you have finished your work so we can review your branch.  We expect that this exercise should take about 90 minutes. This is a guideline, not a fixed limit. Donâ€™t feel rushed to complete the exercise, but work on it as and when you have time.

You can either do both exercises at home, or pick one to send in and do the other as a pairing exercise with us during the technical interview.

We do not have a preference in terms of the way you choose to complete the technical test and we do not factor your choice into our hiring decision. We offer the choice because some candidates find pairing exercise interviews prohibitively nerve-wracking and we want you to be able to show us thought-process for writing software, not how well you cope under extreme pressure.

You can build the templates in either JSX or Handlebars, depending on your preference.

## OPTION 1 - AT HOME:
Please do both exercises before sending in. Remember, you donâ€™t have to do it all in one sitting.

## OPTION 2 - PART AT HOME, PART PAIRING:
Please do one of the exercises before sending in, and we will do the other exercise as a pairing exercise.

For the at home section, we recommend picking the exercise that plays to your strengths and is most relevant to the role you are interested in (e.g. if you are applying for a role where the job description states that most of the work is client-side, build the UI).

## Exercise: Retrieve the data
Use the [securities quotes api](#using-our-securities-quotes-api) (also known as stock prices) to get the data for the items below and output the results in plain HTML.

## Exercise: Build the UI
Build the component in the design below. If you are doing this one at home and the other part pairing in the office, you can use this [sample JSON](test/fixtures/securities-response.json).

The project must have:
- tests. We don't expect comprehensive tests, we would like to see what you can do
- documentation. We don't expect comprehensive documentation, we would like to see what you think is important to document
- error handling

The project could:
- Be responsive
- Be accessible
- Not be reliant on client-side frameworks (i.e. Angular, React) or libraries like jQuery
- Built using Javascript and node.js
- Use Origami Components
- Be progressively enhanced
- Have a similar look and feel as ft.com
- Perform well over 3G networks

Please specify in your submission which one of these points you have addressed and how (e.g. in the `README` of your submission repo) along with documentation, testing, or any other aspects you consider relevant.

## Prerequisites

## Using our Securities Quotes API

To fetch the day's percentage change for a security you can use our Securities Quotes API.

### HTTP Request

`GET https://markets-data-api-proxy.ft.com/research/webservices/securities/v1/quotes`

### URL Query Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `symbols` | Any valid [symbol](Symbols) for a security, or a comma-separated list of [symbols](Symbols), e.g. for the FTSE 100, use `FTSE:FSI`. For the FTSE 100 and S&P 500, use `FTSE:FSI,INX:IOM`.  |

### Symbols

We would like you to display the information from the following symbols (these are the securities we show on the [FT.com front page](https://www.ft.com) ðŸ“°).

## Handlebars

Handlebars is a simple templating language.

We have set this test up to allow you to use either JSX or Handlebars. You can use a different templating language if you prefer, but you will need to add it.

Here is a quick guide that should cover all the bits you need:

OUTPUT data passed to the template
- Data passed in:

		{name: "testUser123"}
- Handlebars template:
		
		Hi {{name}}
- Output:
		
		Hi testUser123

Also supports dot notation for passing in more complex objects
- Data passed in:
		
		{user: {name: "testUser123"}}
- Handlebars template:
		
		Hi {{user.name}}
- Output:
		
		Hi testUser123

Alternatively
- Data passed in:
		
		{user: {name: "testUser123"}}
- Handlebars template:
		
		{{#with user}}{{name}}{{/with}}
- Output:
		
		Hi testUser123

ITERATION
- Data passed in:
		
		{fruit: ["apples", "pears", "oranges"]}
- Handlebars template:
		
		{{#each fruit}}-{{this}}- {{/fruit}}
- Output:
		
		-apples- -pears- -oranges-

CONDITIONALS
- Data passed in:
		
		{isLoggedIn: true}
- Handlebars template:
		
		{{#if isLoggedIn}} My account {{else}} Log in {{/if}} - 
		{{#unless isLoggedIn}} Register {{else}} Logged in {{/unless}}
- Output:
		
		My account - Logged in
